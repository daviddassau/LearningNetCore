# Up and Running with .NET Core
This is getting set up with a new .NET Core project, using the command line and VS Code as the code editor.

### Creating a .NET Core API using the DotNetCli
- Start by making a new directory, or CD'ing into an existing directory.
- The command you want to use to spin up a new project is `dotnet new webapi -o NameOfYourApp.API -n NameOfYourApp.API`.
