# Routing using Angular 6

### Creating a new component
- Right-click on the `app` folder and chose Generate Component. Name it appropriately.
- Check in `app.module.ts` to make sure that your new component has been added to the `@NgModule`.
- Generate a new file at the root of the `app` folder called `routes.ts`. This will hold all of our roots. You will need the following code by default:
```
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
```
